//! This module describes non-CSL inputs to the processor. Specifically, it aims to implement
//! [CSL-JSON](https://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-json/markup.html)
//! ([schema](https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/blob/master/csl-data.json)).
//!
//! These are constructed at deserialization time, i.e. when a [Reference][]
//! is read from CSL-JSON. Any data types that contain strings from the original JSON are typically
//! done with `&'r str` borrows under the [Reference][]'s lifetime `'r`, so the original JSON string
//! cannot be thrown away, but a large number of string allocations is saved.
//!
//! [Reference]: struct.Reference.html
